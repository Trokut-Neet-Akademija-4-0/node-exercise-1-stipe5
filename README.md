**Node.js Application README**

---

### Description:

This Node.js application serves as a basic template for starting a new project. It's structured to kickstart development with Node.js, providing a foundation for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.

### Prerequisites:

- Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Install dependencies using npm:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Development Run:

To start the application in development mode, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This command will start the server using nodemon, which automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected. It's convenient for development as it provides real-time feedback on code changes.

### Usage:

- After starting the server in development mode, you can access the application through your preferred web browser or make API requests using tools like Postman.
- Modify and add endpoints in the `index.js` file to tailor the application according to your requirements.
- Utilize additional npm packages and middleware as needed to extend the functionality of your application.
